Guidelines for tags:
- For 'creation_date', use the exact format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If the date is missing or cannot be verified with high confidence, set it to "unknown".
- For 'author', provide the exact name of the author or organization. If uncertain, set it to "unknown".
- Do not add inferred text like "(inferred from content)".
Ensure that your response is in JSON format with keys 'summary' and 'tags', where 'tags' is an object containing the selected tags.
